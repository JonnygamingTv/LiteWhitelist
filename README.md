# LiteWhitelist
Very efficient yet simple whitelist plugin for Unturned servers.

## Commands
- `/whitelist [steam64id]` - Add player to whitelist
- `/unwhitelist [steam64id]` - Remove player from whitelist
- Prefer editing the config.json file instead? After saving file, run `/rocket reload LiteWhitelist`.
## Plugin
The plugin both checks players on-join and also kicks non-whitelisted players from queue.
